## Code Reviews
- When asked to **review a PR** or **answer a question about code**, do NOT make code edits or run commands unless explicitly asked
- Review tasks are **read-only by default** — provide findings in conversation only
- Do not post GitHub comments unless explicitly asked

## Git & GitHub

- **Never commit without being asked**
- Use `gh` command for GitHub queries (auth already configured)

### Commit Message

- Max 3 bullet points
- Consider only the actual changes being committed
